This crate provides a Rust driver for the AS3935 Franklin Lightning Sensor IC.
It provides an easy to use high-level asynchronous API to interact with the sensor which provides
you with a non-blocking [channel](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html) of events.

It's currently built on top of [rppal library](https://crates.io/crates/rppal) and as such is limited to
Raspberry Pi.
